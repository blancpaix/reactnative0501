Some of your project's dependencies are not compatible with currently installed expo package version:
 - react-native-reanimated - expected version range: ~1.7.0 - actual version installed: ^1.8.0
 - react-native-screens - expected version range: ~2.2.0 - actual version installed: ^2.7.0
Your project may not work correctly until you install the correct versions of the packages.
To install the correct versions of these packages, please run: expo install [package-name ...]

expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view
npm install react-navigation-stack @react-native-community/masked-view
npm start -c


dependencies should be installed by expo...
